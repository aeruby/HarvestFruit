# HarvestFruit: Deep Q-Learning Agent

# Overview:
 The gardener learns to navigate a 5x5 garden to harvest fruits efficiently using Deep Q-Learning and a neural network, a simple AI project where we train a gardener to move around a small garden and harvest as many fruits as possible within a limited number of steps. 

# Technologies Used:
- Python
- TensorFlow
- NumPy

# Limitations:
